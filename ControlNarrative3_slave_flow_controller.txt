Secondary Control Loop: FIC-001 (Slave Flow Controller)
    ***WHERE?*** - Slave flow controller in cascade arrangement with TIC-002, controlling inlet flow to reactor via control valve positioned upstream of reactor. 
    Flow transmitter FT-001 provides process feedback. Receives external setpoint from TIC-002 master controller.
    ***WHY?*** - Functions as slave controller in cascade system to     provide rapid response to flow disturbances before they can upset reactor temperature. 
    Maintains precise flow control to achieve temperature control objectives determined by master controller TIC-002. Improves overall control system performance and disturbance 
    rejection.
    ***WHAT?*** - Slave flow controller accepting external setpoint from TIC-002 output and maintaining actual flow rate to match this setpoint. Provides fast inner loop control in 
    cascade strategy. Includes flow indication, high/low flow alarms, and valve position indication for operational feedback.
    ***HOW?*** - PID flow controller receives setpoint signal from TIC-002, compares to actual flow measurement from FT-001, and adjusts control valve position accordingly. 
    Tuned for fast response without oscillation to minimize flow disturbances that could affect reactor temperature control.
    ***WHEN?*** - Operational in cascade mode during normal reactor operation. Can be switched to manual mode with operator-defined setpoint when cascade is broken or during 
    startup/shutdown sequences. Active whenever flow control to the reactor is required.
    ***WHAT IF?*** - FT-001 failure: Switch to manual valve control, break cascade connection with TIC-002, rely on manual flow estimation and direct temperature control. 
    Control valve failure: Isolate flow path, activate backup feed system if available, emergency reactor shutdown if no alternatives. Loss of setpoint from TIC-002: 
    Controller maintains last received setpoint, switch to manual mode with operator-defined setpoint. Cascade communication failure: Break cascade, operate both controllers 
    independently in manual mode.
