Primary Control Loop: TIC-002 (Master Temperature Controller)
***WHERE?*** - Master temperature controller receiving input from the high temperature selector. Located in the control system with output providing cascade setpoint 
to FIC-001 flow controller. Controls overall reactor temperature through manipulation of inlet flow rate.
***WHY?*** - Reactor temperature control is critical for safety, 
product quality, reaction kinetics, and preventing thermal runaway. Cascade control strategy employed because flow changes provide faster temperature response than 
direct thermal manipulation. Temperature control prevents equipment damage and maintains process efficiency.
***WHAT?*** - Master controller in cascade control system that maintains reactor temperature at setpoint by manipulating the setpoint of the slave flow controller FIC-001. 
Receives temperature feedback from high selector and provides flow setpoint output. Includes temperature indication, alarm functions, and emergency shutdown capabilities.
***HOW?*** - PID temperature controller receives highest temperature signal from high selector, compares to temperature setpoint, and calculates required flow setpoint for FIC-001. 
Controller output scaled to provide appropriate flow setpoint range. Includes adaptive tuning and anti-windup protection.
WHEN? Operational during all reactor operating modes when temperature control is required. Active continuously during normal operation. Can be switched to manual mode during 
startup/shutdown procedures or cascade system maintenance, providing fixed setpoint to FIC-001.
***WHAT IF?*** - Input failure from high selector: Switch to manual mode, use backup temperature indication if available, consider controlled shutdown. High temperature alarm: 
Controller automatically reduces flow setpoint to FIC-001, activates emergency cooling if configured. Controller failure: Break cascade, operate FIC-001 in manual mode with fixed 
setpoint, implement manual temperature monitoring and control. Setpoint deviation: Check for process upsets, controller tuning issues, or equipment problems affecting heat removal.
